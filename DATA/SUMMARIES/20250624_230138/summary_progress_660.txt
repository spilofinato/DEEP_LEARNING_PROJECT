Here's a consolidated summary of the provided text, detailing the recovery credit project for MIM, along with key actions and decisions made from 2003 to 2009:

**Project Overview:**

The “Recupero Crediti – MIM” project (ID 660), initiated in October 2003, aimed to improve the invoicing and debt recovery processes for MIM clients. The project evolved over several years, involving numerous personnel and external partners, including Datafin and FG. A core challenge was managing the increasing reliance on digital services and the associated manual processes.

**Key Actions & Decisions (2003-2008):**

* **Initial Setup (2003-2004):**  The project began with a focus on formalizing the invoicing process, establishing data recording standards, and tracking payments via postal transfers. Morena Forti (FOM) played a central role in data collection and analysis.  The importance of including client VAT numbers in payment descriptions was recognized.
* **Digital Service Integration Challenges (2007):**  In November 2007, Luigi Meroni (LM) highlighted the inefficiencies caused by clients’ inability to complete online orders and utilize digital services (PuntoSicuro subscriptions, online courses). This prompted a call for streamlining operations and eliminating back-office work.
* **Partner Engagement (2007-2008):**  Efforts were made to leverage external partners like Banca Sella (Gandolfi), PDV, CFA, Intesa, BCV, and AGI. There were multiple discussions about Datafin’s role, including a decision to postpone integrating debts with them until the end of May 2008.
* **Data Management & Accuracy:**  A constant concern was the accuracy of data input, particularly regarding client identification (VAT numbers, order details) and payment instructions.  MC (Marco Colucci) routinely investigated discrepancies.
* **Process Refinement:**  Regular meetings were held to refine the debt recovery process, involving FOM, MC, ALM (Luigi Meroni), and CUT (a team). 
* **Weekly Monitoring & Reporting:**  A key component was the establishment of weekly monitoring cycles, with MC, FOM, and others reviewing outstanding debts and identifying areas for intervention.

**Key Figures & Roles:**

* **Morena Forti (FOM):** Responsible for data collection, analysis, and decision-making.
* **Luigi Meroni (LM):** Overall project oversight, coordination, and engagement with partners.
* **Marco Colucci (MC):**  Focused on contacting clients, investigating discrepancies, and working with Datafin.
* **Luigi Meroni (ALM):**  Played a key role in coordinating the project and managing relationships with external partners.

**Later Developments (2009):**

* **E.Keeper Issues:** In April 2009, a major issue emerged with the E.Keeper system, highlighting the need for clients to clearly identify themselves on payment instructions (including customer codes and order numbers). This spurred a further review of data collection practices.



This consolidated summary offers a comprehensive overview of the project’s timeline and key activities, showcasing the challenges and ongoing efforts to manage and recover debts from MIM clients.
