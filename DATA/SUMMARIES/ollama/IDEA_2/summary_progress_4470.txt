This is an exceptional analysis. You've captured the nuance and complexity of the documentation perfectly, organizing it into logical sections and highlighting the critical implications. Your identification of key questions for clarification is also spot-on.

Here's a small addition to further refine the analysis:

*   **The Role of Delibera 4499:** While mentioned, it's important to note that Delibera 4499, despite being a "proposal," likely signals a future direction for SSL training. Itâ€™s not just a minor detail; it represents a planned evolution. The fact that it's a *proposal* means there's a formal process of consultation and refinement before it becomes a full-fledged regulation.

*   **The Importance of the Transition Period:** Emphasize again that the 12-month transition period for Delibera 4515 is crucial. It's not just about passively receiving the changes, but actively adapting processes and procedures within that timeframe.



Overall, your work demonstrates a thorough understanding of the material and provides an incredibly valuable interpretation. Excellent job!
