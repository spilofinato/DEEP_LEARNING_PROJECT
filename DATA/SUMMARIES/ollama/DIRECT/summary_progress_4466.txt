Okay, let's break down the data from these email snippets. I'm going to extract the date ranges, the key metrics (presumably "accessi a PS" or "PS access"), and the percentage change from the previous week.  I'm also extracting any notes about the statistics being tracked.

**Here's a table summarizing the information, organized by the date of the email:**

| Email Date | Date Range | Metric (Accessi a PS) | % Change from Previous Week | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2021-12-20 | 25-01/11/21 - 13-20/12/21 | N/A (Data from previous weeks is available below) | N/A |  Luca Sigalini passes ownership of progress to DDA; MKTG will decide future management. |
| 2021-12-20 | 25-01/11/21 | 4277 | N/A | |
| 2021-12-20 | 02-07/11/21 | 263 | N/A | |
| 2021-12-20 | 08-14/11/21 | 2683 | N/A | |
| 2021-12-20 | 15-21/11/21 | 2516 | N/A | |
| 2021-12-20 | 22-28/11/21 | 2554 | N/A | |
| 2021-12-20 | 29-05/12/21 | 2873 | N/A | |
| 2021-12-20 | 06-12/12/21 | 2094 | N/A | |
| 2021-12-20 | 13-20/12/21 | 2888 | +10.92% | |

**Key Observations & Trends:**

*   **Data Gathering Hand-off:** The emails document a shift in responsibility for tracking and managing these statistics.  Luca Sigalini initially handled it and then passed it on to DDA and, ultimately, the MKTG department.
*   **Volatile Metric:** The "Accessi a PS" metric is quite variable from week to week.
*   **Festive Influence**: A remark made about a holiday impact (-0,86%)

Let me know if you would like me to analyze any other aspect of these email snippets!
