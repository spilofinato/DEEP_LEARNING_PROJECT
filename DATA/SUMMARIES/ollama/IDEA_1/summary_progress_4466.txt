Okay, this is a challenging extraction task! The provided text isn't structured in a way that lends itself to easy data retrieval. Here's what I've done, aiming for accuracy while acknowledging the limitations, and incorporating the clarifications provided so far.

**Understanding the Data and Context**

*   **Metric:** The data appears to represent *logins*, as indicated in previous discussions.
*   **Dates:** The dates are "week-ending" dates â€“ meaning they represent the logins recorded up to and including that date.
*   **Previous Clarification:** The dates are in the "MM-DD/MM-DD" format.

**Extracted Data Table**

Here's the extracted data, focusing on the Login Count and the % Change from the previous week. I've added some notes to highlight uncertainties where the text was ambiguous.

| Week Ending Date (MM-DD/MM-DD) | Login Count | % Change from Previous Week | Notes/Uncertainties |
|---|---|---|---|
| 11-17/11-23 | 3439  | N/A |  This is the starting point, so no previous week to compare. |
| 11-24/11-30 | 2880 | -16.4% |  Calculated from previous week. |
| 12-07/12-13 | 3249 | 12.3% | Calculated from previous week. |
| 12-14/12-20 | 3577 | 10.2% | Calculated from previous week. |
| 12-21/12-27 | 3617 | 1.0% | Calculated from previous week. |
| 12-28/01-03 | 3513 | -2.7% | Calculated from previous week. |
| 01-04/01-10 | 3824 | 8.8% | Calculated from previous week. |
| 01-11/01-17 | 3709 | -2.9% | Calculated from previous week. |
| 01-18/01-24 | 3837 | 3.1% | Calculated from previous week. |
| 01-25/01-31 | 3987 | 3.3% | Calculated from previous week. |
| 02-01/02-07 | 4383 | 9.6% | Calculated from previous week. |
| 02-08/02-14 | 4318 | -1.8% | Calculated from previous week. |
| 02-15/02-21 | 4257 | -1.6% | Calculated from previous week. |
| 02-22/02-28 | 4141 | -2.8% | Calculated from previous week. |
| 03-01/03-07 | 4009 | -3.3% | Calculated from previous week. |

**Important Notes & Caveats:**

*   **Ambiguity:** Some numbers were difficult to read precisely. I've done my best to interpret them, but there's a possibility of error.
*   **Rounding:** Percentage changes are rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent.
*   **Data Gaps:**  The original text likely contained more data points than I could confidently extract. There might be missing weeks.
* **Inconsistent Formatting**: In a few places, the data was exceptionally hard to parse. There is an increased chance of error in those rows.



To improve the accuracy of the extraction and fill in any gaps, it would be immensely helpful to have access to the original document or a clearer, more structured version of the data.
