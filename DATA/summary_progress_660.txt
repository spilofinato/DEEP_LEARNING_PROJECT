Okay, let's break down this vast collection of emails and notes related to MIM's financial processes.  Here's a summary, grouped by key themes and highlighting the evolving issues and proposed solutions. I'll structure it to be digestible and useful.  I'm also including a timeline at the end.

**I. Core Problem: Payment Processing Inefficiency & Data Matching Issues**

The central issue consistently recurring is the inefficiency in processing payments, particularly those from customers of MIM. This inefficiency manifests in multiple ways:

*   **Time Consuming for MC:** MC (likely the person handling payment reconciliation) is spending a significant portion of their time (1/3) on payment reconciliation, far exceeding what's considered efficient.
*   **Data Discrepancies:**  Frequent discrepancies between payment information (customer name, order number) and internal records are causing delays and requiring manual intervention.
*   **E-Keeper Issues:**  Payments made through E-Keeper (a payment system) are particularly problematic due to missing or incorrect information.  The systemâ€™s basic license limits customization.
*   **Bollettino Postale Payment Issues:**  Bollettino Postale payments are difficult to interpret due to a lack of information.
*   **Lack of Standardized Processes:** A lack of standardized processes and clear communication between departments (MIM, FOM, PDC) compounds the problems.

**II. Specific Areas & Solutions - A Chronological Breakdown (Roughly)**

Let's organize these by timeframe and problem.  Keep in mind the dates given are likely meeting dates or note-taking.

**A. Early Stages (Late 2008 - Early 2009): Initial Focus on Data & Bank Reconciliation**

*   **Issue:** Unidentified bank reconciliation issues.
*   **Action:** ALM and FOM scheduled a meeting to review and resolve the unknown issues (June 10th, 2009).
*   **Action:**  A subsequent meeting was rescheduled (June 13th, 2009)

**B. Mid 2009:  Focus on Bollettino Postale, Punto Sicuro (Subscription Database), and Data Input.**

*   **Issue:** Difficulty interpreting payments made via *Bollettino Postale*.
*   **Solution Attempted:** MC started presenting postal justifications to MBF for identification, but this was deemed insufficient.
*   **Issue:**  Management of customers subscribing to *Punto Sicuro* was being handled by FG.
*   **Action:** FG would send electronic invoices to MC, in hopes of automating the matching process, but this wasn't ultimately helpful.
*   **Issue:** Difficulty identifying customer data when payments were made via *Punto Sicuro*.

**C. April 2009: Deep Dive into E-Keeper Problems & Process Improvements**

*   **Issue:** E-Keeper payments lacking sufficient information.
*   **Proposed Solution:** Customers were to be *obligated* to include their customer code and order number in E-Keeper payments.
*   **Solution Attempted:**  MIM would communicate the customer code and order number to customers during order acceptance.
*   **Issue:** Difficulty with E-Keeper data leading to reliance on FOM's email to find the correct customer.
*   **Issue:** Lack of Customization: Basic E-Keeper License, hindering solutions.
*   **Action:** MC requested that LM explore potential upgrade for E-Keeper license.
*   **Issue:** Customer data often incorrect.
*   **Action:** ALM and LM scheduled a meeting to evaluate the problems.

**D.  May 2008 & Ongoing: Point of Sale (POS) and Invoice Information**

*   **Issue:** Payments made to the database often arrived without accurate POS data.
*   **Action:** PDC was tasked with sending a list of subscribers to MC.
*   **Issue:** Lack of Data in Postale Payment
*   **Action:** All customer payments must include customer code and order number.
*   **Issue:** Data Verification
*   **Action:** MC can request assistance from FOM

**III. Key Individuals & Departments**

*   **ALM:**  (Likely a manager/director) Driving the improvement initiatives. Responsible for review and problem solving.
*   **LM:**  (Likely a manager/director)  Working alongside ALM to address issues and implement changes.  Responsible for contacting external vendors like Banca Sella.
*   **MC:**  (Likely a payment processor/accountant)  Experiencing the payment processing challenges firsthand and providing valuable feedback.
*   **FOM:**  (Department, likely Finance/Operations Management) Involved in reconciliation and providing data.
*   **PDC:** (Department, likely Sales/Order Processing) Responsible for managing customer subscriptions and providing related data.
*   **FG:**  (Department, likely Sales/Order Processing) Previously managing Punto Sicuro Subscribers.
*   **MBF:** (Individual, presumably a manager, dealing with postal justifications)
*   **CUT:** (Individual, part of Banca Sella, involved in verification)
*   **Gandolfi:** (Contact at Banca Sella - for movement reconciliation)

**IV. Timeline (Approximate)**

*   **Late 3008:** Initial concerns about bank reconciliation.
*   **April 2009:**  Significant focus on E-Keeper issues, customer code requirements.
*   **May 2008:** Focus on Punto Sicuro and invoice information.
*   **June 2009:** Meeting scheduled, then rescheduled, for payment review.
*   **Ongoing:** Continuing efforts to improve payment processes.
